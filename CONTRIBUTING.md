# Contributing to W230 Experiments

## Overview

This repository contains experimental prototypes. Contributions are welcome from invited collaborators.

## Guidelines

1. **Each experiment is isolated**: Work within the specific experiment folder (e.g., `cineflow/`).
2. **No secrets**: Never commit API keys, credentials, or sensitive data. Use `.env.local` files (gitignored).
3. **Keep it experimental**: This is not production code. Prioritize exploration over polish.
4. **Document your work**: Update the experiment's README if you add significant features.

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes
3. Test locally
4. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "feat(cineflow): add new feature"`
5. Push and create a PR: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
